            <p>“Everybody can be great because everybody can serve.”  <br>
               “Life's most persistent and urgent question is:<br>
                What are you doing for others?”<br>
               “Earn your success based on service to others,<br> 
               not at the expenseof others"<br>
               Putting other people's needs before yours <br>
               also strengthens your relationships.<br>
               It connects you with the one you're serving,<br>
               and if that someone is someone you<br>
             know, it creates a stronger bond with them.<br>
               It also enriches other people's lives.<br></p>
